Column G instructions 25-30 csv 1

(Column G I call the group number)
We need to find what group (number) to put the names in
(all same names and same last 3 letters go into 1 group number

example
1st csv
10 rows of abby cross, rpr

inventory has 1-9999 rows of Abby Cross rpr and
its group number is (G column) is 19
(all matching name and 3 letter code will be in same group)

1st csv 
will take that number (Group number) from inventory
and place it into G (19) (all 10 of them, they are all in the same "group"

another example

1st csv
10 rows of abby cross, rpr 

inventory has 1 row of Abby Cross rpr and
its group number is (G column) is 19
(all matching name and 3 letter code will be in same group)

1st csv 
will take that number (Group number) from inventory and 
place it into G (19) (all 10 of them, they are all in the same "group"


no matches (no matching groups)

example

1st csv
10 rows of abby cross, rpr

inventory has 0 rows of Abby Cross rpr to match

now you will look at column G of inventory file
assign the next unused group number to the 10 rows (on 1st csv)

so if the number 5 is not used on the inventory sheet

5 will be assigned to all 10 rows of abby cross
(1st csv)

I think you kinda got it this time, only got confussed a little
