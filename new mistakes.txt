Didn't get -

option 2
1st csv
Column G
Suppose to be the name, not numbers

option 3
2nd csv
looks good accept
when it finds a new number value in column g (no matches on inventory)
it doesnt add values to column F
It should keep the same rule for column F, no matter what happens in column g
